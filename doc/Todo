New features specific to moosic (the command-line client):
  - Add support for a ".moosicrc" configuration file to store default options
    that would otherwise have to be set on the command-line.
  - Find a way to let users specify queue ranges that start with a negative
    number without requiring a '--' to separate the range argument from the
    option parser.  Possibilities: '[-9:-3]', '{-9:-3}', '(-9:-3)', '/-9:-3/',
    '/-9:-3', '=-9:-3', ',-9:-3', '.-9:-3', ':-9:-3:'.  Surrounding with slashes
    seems the best, since it doesn't conflict with shell meta-characters, and
    it's easy to type, and it's one of the least visually unappealing choices.

New features specific to moosicd:
====== Short term goals ======
  - Implement server methods that allow remote clients to inspect (a possibly
    restricted portion of) the filesystem of the computer on which the server is
    running. (Possibly in a separate daemon.)
  - Implement server methods that allow remote clients to change the sound
    volume. (Possibly in a separate daemon.)
====== Long term goals ======
  - Provide a hook for providing notification of when a song is started or
    stopped.
  - Devise a plugin-based system for handling individual songs.  This would
    require a small revision to the config file format, but the impact of this
    revision could be minimized.
  - Measure the current song's total length in time.
  - Measure the amount of time until the current song will finish.
  - Support methods for seeking within a song. 
  - Implement skipping to the next playlist in a list.

Web site:
  - Create a page listing and thanking contributors to the project.
  - Create a page with a list of related projects.

Invisible implementation details:
  - Explicitly define and document the semantics of inserting the empty string
    into the song queue.

Alternative clients:
  - Write a GTK+ GUI client (gmoosic).
  - Write a GNUstep/Cocoa GUI client (MoosicStep/MoosicX).
  - A curses client (cmoosic), a PHP-based web client (php-moosic), and an
    interactive command interpreter client (moosicsh) are left as exercises to
    the reader (or me, if I get really bored).
  - Internationalize everything.
