    # The song-type matcher is specified first, and consists of a pair of
    # strings. The first string specifies the method of matching, and the
    # subsequent strings provide the information that the matcher needs to
    # identify a particular type.

    # The song-type handler is specified second, and also consists of a pair
    # strings. The first string specifies the kind of the handler, and the
    # second string specifies the information needed to create a specific
    # instance of a handler of that kind.

    # Methods of detection include matching by regular expression, by wildcard
    # pattern, by magic number, and by the is_our_file() method of XMMS/BMP
    # plugins.

    # input/output plugin pair, a BMP input/output plugin pair, a GStreamer
